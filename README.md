# Huckleberry Agency Website

This is my first workshop for Joshwcomeau's Css course for Javascript developers, I built a minimal landing page for an agency.

This mockup is built entirely using _flow layout_: no Flexbox, no grid, no absolute positioning, no media queries. It relies heavily on padding, margin, and border, as well as some of the tricks we learned in Module 1.

The design is available on Figma:

## Setup Instructions

This project uses an NPM package called "live-server" â€” it provides a basic local file server, so that you can view the HTML file in-browser, and automatically reloads the page when the HTML/CSS changes.

Start by installing dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the "start" script to start the server:

```
npm run start
```

You should see a confirmation message like this:

You can visit `http://localhost:9000` to view the page. You should see a bunch of unstyled content:

> **Trouble with this process?**

 This project is vanilla HTML and CSS, you can always open the HTML file in your browser, without fussing with a local file server.
>
> Certain JS APIs won't work when viewing files in this way, but that isn't a concern for this project.


- **Pay close attention to alignment.** For example, you should be able to draw a line along the left, and all text should be neatly aligned:

## Design tokens

In the early days of the web, sites would be built largely on "feel". Colors and sizes would be chosen based on the whims of the moment. This led to some very inconsistent-looking websites!

Nowadays, it's common to have a set of _design tokens_. A design token is a value that can be reused. Typically, it's part of a collection or a scale.

We'll learn more about this idea later, but for now, you can copy/paste the values from this list as-needed. Don't worry about being DRY or using variables; Plop these values in, wherever you need them.

**If you find it difficult to use these tokens, or if you're not able to achieve a result you're happy with, don't worry about it.** Solve it however you can, and then watch the solution video to see how I did it.

### Spacing

This app uses an 8px unit. All spaces are a multiple of 8px:

- `8px`
- `16px`
- `24px`
- `32px`
- `48px`
- `64px`
- `96px`
- `128px`

When it comes to max widths (e.g. the maximum width of the card), arbitrary values can be used.

### Font

1 font is used in this project: `Lato`. It is already included in the stylesheet.

For font sizes, the `rem` unit should be used.

The scale is:

- `1rem`
- `1.25rem`
- `1.5rem`
- `2rem`

By default, `1rem` is equivalent to `16px`.

### Color palette

Primary (green):

- `hsl(160deg, 100%, 30%)`

Secondary (gold):

- `hsl(45deg, 100%, 50%)` (lighter)
- `hsl(45deg, 100%, 40%)` (darker)

Grays:

- `hsl(0deg, 0%, 0%)` (black)
- `hsl(0deg, 0%, 10%)` (very dark)
- `hsl(0deg, 0%, 30%)` (dark)
- `hsl(0deg, 0%, 40%)` (medium)
- `hsl(0deg, 0%, 60%)` (light)
- `hsl(0deg, 0%, 100%)` (white)
